# Test assignment 1  

## Frameworks:  
The two project examples have been made with TDD and BDD with help of JUnit, TestNG and Cucumber.  
The meaning of this assignment is to be able to setup a testing environment with Cucumber. Assignment-1 has written test to test out the setup.
  
#### TODO:  
Cucumber seem to be caching the same feature files across all of the features. Fix bug if I have time.
Furthermore, I could use the newer dependencies from cucumber.io:  
```   
		<dependency>
                    <groupId>io.cucumber</groupId>
                    <artifactId>cucumber-java</artifactId>
                    <version>7.8.0</version>
                    <scope>test</scope>
                </dependency>
                <dependency>
                    <groupId>io.cucumber</groupId>
                    <artifactId>cucumber-spring</artifactId>
                    <version>7.8.0</version>
                    <scope>test</scope>
                </dependency>
                <dependency>
                    <groupId>io.cucumber</groupId>
                    <artifactId>cucumber-junit-platform-engine</artifactId>
                    <version>7.8.0</version>
                    <scope>test</scope>
                </dependency>  
```
